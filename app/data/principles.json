    "Don’t criticize, condemn or complain. This is straight forward in its emphasis in keeping negativity away from your interactions. People don't like feeling devalued or the sensation that they are being complained about. Instead of pointing out weaknesses, focus on strengths and opportunities for improvement. If something is not right, address it in a manner that creates solutions, not just highlighting problems - this is far more inspiring and constructive.",
    "Give honest and sincere appreciation: When you appreciate people, it shows that you value their contribution. Acknowledge their efforts, validate their feelings and praise their achievements. People can differentiate between a genuine compliment and a fake one, thus, always be real. For example, when someone does a good job, don't just say “good job”, be specific about what you liked about his/her work.",
    "Arouse in the other person an eager want: This is about motivating others to take action. Understand what drives the other person, what their needs or desires are, and show them how they can achieve what they crave or need. This principle can be applied in negotiations or when seeking alliance with someone. Pledge benefits that they would derive from the arrangement.",
    "Become genuinely interested in other people: Show interest in people's stories, their experiences, and aspirations. Ask open-ended questions and get to know them better. People will pick up on your sincerity, and will be more likely to trust and engage with you.",
    "Smile: A simple smile can make others feel comfortable around you. It creates a positive and welcoming energy around you that others will gravitate towards. But just like appreciation, the smile should be genuine.",
    "Say their name: When you use a person's name during a conversation, it sends a message that you see them as a unique individual. It creates a level of personal connection and draws their attention making them more receptive to what you have to say.",
    "Be a good listener: Good listening is about fully focusing on the other person when they are talking and resisting the urge to interrupt. Make sure to give feedback, ask follow-up questions, and do your best to understand their perspective. A good listener can gain a lot of trust and respect.",
    "Talk in terms of the other person’s interests: Find out what the other person is passionate about, and ask them about it or look for ways to relate it back to the topic of conversation. If you know a colleague enjoys golf, for example, you might discuss a recent golf tournament. This makes the conversation more interesting to them and helps you build a stronger relationship."
